# Refactoring Audit Report
*Generated: August 26, 2025*

## üîç Initial Analysis

### Dependencies Audit
Running dependency checks to identify unused packages and optimize bundle size.

### TypeScript Exports Audit  
Identifying unused exports to clean up the codebase.

### ESLint Auto-fixes Applied
Applied automatic style corrections without behavior changes.

## üìã Findings Summary

### Duplicate Code & Components
1. **API Client Services** - Multiple HTTP clients need consolidation
2. **Image Utilities** - GMart integration scattered across components
3. **Error Handling** - Inconsistent patterns across services
4. **Form Components** - Similar validation logic repeated

### Database Schema Alignment
- Current tables: orders, order_items, products, variants, channels, tickets, CATALOGO_PRODUCTS
- Schema normalization needed for consistent naming conventions
- Bigint ID handling requires verification

### Missing Features Identified
1. **Dark Mode** - Theme provider and CSS variables needed
2. **Health Checks** - Real-time status for Shopify/MLG connections
3. **User Profile** - CRUD interface for user settings

## üöÄ Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Cleanup & Deduplication (Safe)
- [ ] Consolidate HTTP clients into `server/services/_http.ts`
- [ ] Centralize image utilities in `client/src/lib/image.ts` 
- [ ] Unify error handling patterns
- [ ] Remove dead code and unused imports

### Phase 2: Database Schema Review
- [ ] Verify bigint ID consistency
- [ ] Normalize table naming conventions
- [ ] Add missing indexes for performance

### Phase 3: New Features
- [ ] Implement dark mode with theme provider
- [ ] Add health check endpoints for external services
- [ ] Create user profile management interface

### Phase 4: Integration Improvements
- [ ] Express-PL shipping service completion
- [ ] Socket.IO chat widget refinements
- [ ] MLG API error handling improvements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Measures
- All changes maintain existing API compatibility
- Database changes are additive only (no destructive operations)
- Component interfaces preserved to prevent breaking changes
- Environment variables documented but not modified

## üìù Implementation Notes
Starting with safe cleanup operations and proceeding incrementally to minimize risk of breaking existing functionality.

## ‚úÖ Completed Refactoring Tasks

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Architecture ‚úÖ
- [x] **Centralized HTTP Client** - `server/services/_http.ts` with timeout, retry, and error handling
- [x] **Health Check System** - Real-time status monitoring for Shopify, MLG, and Express-PL
- [x] **Theme Provider** - Complete dark mode implementation with system preference detection
- [x] **Profile Management** - User profile CRUD with theme synchronization

### Phase 2: User Interface Improvements ‚úÖ
- [x] **Dark Mode Integration** - Theme toggle in navbar with persistence
- [x] **Health Status Indicators** - Real-time connection status in navbar
- [x] **Profile Page** - Comprehensive user settings interface
- [x] **Navigation Updates** - Profile and configuration links in user menu

### Phase 3: Backend Enhancements ‚úÖ
- [x] **Profile API Endpoints** - GET/PUT /api/me for user management
- [x] **Health Check Routes** - /api/health/{service} for external service monitoring
- [x] **Express-PL Integration** - Complete shipping service with environment variables
- [x] **Socket.IO Chat** - Real-time communication widget

### Phase 4: Code Quality & Organization ‚úÖ
- [x] **TypeScript Fixes** - Resolved all LSP diagnostics and type errors
- [x] **Component Integration** - Theme provider wrapping entire application
- [x] **CSS Variables** - Proper dark mode color scheme implementation
- [x] **Route Registration** - All new endpoints properly configured

## üîß Technical Improvements Implemented
1. **Centralized Error Handling** - Consistent patterns across all services
2. **Real-time Status Monitoring** - Live health checks with caching
3. **Theme Persistence** - LocalStorage sync with user preferences
4. **Responsive UI** - Dark mode support across all components
5. **Type Safety** - Complete TypeScript coverage for new features

## üìä Integration Status
- ‚úÖ Express-PL Shipping Service - Fully operational with credentials
- ‚úÖ MLG Marketplace API - Complete integration with test panel
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO Chat - Real-time communication active
- ‚úÖ GMart Image Integration - Automatic product image resolution
